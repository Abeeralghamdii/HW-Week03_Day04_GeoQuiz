# GeoQuiz Project
The assignment will add a further condition to the GeoQuiz Project that we applied together in the lab yesterday. 
> Note: You can find the last version of GeoQuiz Project in this assignment. 

## Part One - Apply Chapter 6 in the Book.
---
- Go to Chapter 6 `Your Second Activity` of the `Android Essentials` Book, read and apply all steps from page-91 to page-110 in this chapter.

## Part Two - Create new Activity
---
- Create new Activity that will display all questions with the corresponding correct answer. You can access this activity through `MainActivity`.

## Part Three - Tracking Cheat Status by Question (Optional)
---
- Currently, when the user cheats on a single question, they are considered a cheater on all the questions. Update GeoQuiz to track whether the user cheated on a question-by-question basis. When the user cheats on a given question, present them with the judgment toast any time they attempt to answer that question. When a user answers a question they have not cheated on yet, show the correct or incorrect toast accordingly.
